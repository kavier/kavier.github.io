                            <h2>What Is a Black Hole?</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p>
                            This article is part of the NASA Knows! (Grades K-4) series. A black hole is a place in
                            space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. The gravity is so strong
                            because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying.
                            Because no light can get out, people can't see black holes. They are invisible. Space
                            telescopes with special tools can help find black holes. The special tools can see how
                            stars that are very close to black holes act differently than other stars. How Big Are
                            Black Holes? Black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest black holes
                            are as small as just one atom. These black holes are very tiny but have the mass of a large
                            mountain. Mass is the amount of matter, or "stuff," in an object. Another kind of black
                            hole is called "stellar." Its mass can be up to 20 times more than the mass of the sun.
                            There may be many, many stellar mass black holes in Earth's galaxy. Earth's galaxy is
                            called the Milky Way. The largest black holes are called "supermassive." These black holes have
                            masses that are more than 1 million suns together. Scientists have found proof that every large
                            galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at its center. The supermassive black hole at the center
                            of the Milky Way galaxy is called Sagittarius A. It has a mass equal to ...

                            <h2>The Difference Between Black & White Holes</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p>
                            People like to think of black holes and white holes as gateways through the universe.
                            It would be rather convenient if we could enter a black hole, zip across the universe,
                            and come out at some distant point in space (and maybe even time). Sure, figuring out the
                            exact mechanics would be tricky, but once we had the pattern down, it would make
                            interstellar travel, and probably intergalactic travel, a breeze. However, this view of
                            white holes isn’t exactly accurate.

                            To begin, let’s start with a black hole, because they are a lot easier to explain. Do you
                            remember how teachers would go on and on about how Newton discovered that gravity is
                            universal? Well, Newton’s discovery of the laws of motion says that every mass pulls at
                            every other mass with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely
                            proportional to the square of the displacement separating them.

                            However, after Einstein, we knew that Newtonian mechanics must be wrong. At the very basic
                            level, this theory is not correct because it is a scheme that works faster than the speed
                            of light (essentially, it claims that if you remove the Sun from our solar system, all
                            the planets would begin spinning off into interstellar space before the last light of
                            the Sun reached them i.e., the force of gravity would travel faster than the speed of
                            light). Einstein showed ...
