                        <h2>The Difference Between Black & White Holes</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p align="justify">
                        People like to think of black holes and white holes as gateways through the universe.
                        It would be rather convenient if we could enter a black hole, zip across the universe,
                        and come out at some distant point in space (and maybe even time). Sure, figuring out the
                        exact mechanics would be tricky, but once we had the pattern down, it would make
                        interstellar travel, and probably intergalactic travel, a breeze. However, this view of
                        white holes isn't exactly accurate.

                        To begin, let's start with a black hole, because they are a lot easier to explain. Do you
                        remember how teachers would go on and on about how Newton discovered that gravity is
                        universal? Well, Newton's discovery of the laws of motion says that every mass pulls at
                        every other mass with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely
                        proportional to the square of the displacement separating them.

                        However, after Einstein, we knew that Newtonian mechanics must be wrong. At the very basic
                        level, this theory is not correct because it is a scheme that works faster than the speed
                        of light (essentially, it claims that if you remove the Sun from our solar system, all
                        the planets would begin spinning off into interstellar space before the last light of
                        the Sun reached them i.e., the force of gravity would travel faster than the speed of
                        light). Einstein showed us how this theory is flawed through his explanation of the
                        curvature of spacetime.

                        But Einstein, just having written down the celebrated Einstein Field Equations describing
                        the curvature of spacetime, began to fret. The equation was nonlinear, and while it is
                        still nice and simple to look at, nonlinearity means that we don't know how to solve the
                        equations (a nonlinear system is one where the equation being solved can't be written as
                        a linear combination of the unknown variables or functions that appear in it).

                        And then, in the middle of war, Schwarzchild sent him a letter with the solution.

                        Schwarzchild's solution refers to the case like the following: where you think all the
                        energy of the Sun is squeezed to one infinitesimal point (with no momentum at all), and
                        where we are interested in the spacetime everywhere else but at the point. This idea is
                        really the same as us taking the Earth's complete mass and thinking it is just one point
                        in the center - it's a convenient mathematical trick for doing calculations fast and
                        simple, but it is not to be taken too seriously when talking about what a black hole
                        actually is - only when talking about how the universe outside of the black hole operates.

                        Regardless, in essence, a black hole is something that pulls, and in stricter terms, it
                        pulls from a place you do not want to get near. In this case, "near" refers to the Event
                        Horizon. In short, the Event Horizon of a black hole is a name we give to the region of
                        spacetime beyond which anything that drops into it can never come back out. Not even light
                        itself.

                        This is contrasted by a white hole, which literally pushes you away by spitting material
                        at you. This is the reverse: A white hole spits out everything and nothing goes in. So
                        while a black hole has an event horizon that, once you get close enough, you can never
                        escape, a white hole has an event horizon that you can never even get close to (and that
                        is not even counting the burning that you would get when you try!).
